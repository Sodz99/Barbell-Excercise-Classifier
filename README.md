## üìù Overview

Strength training is essential for fitness, yet tracking free-weight exercises remains underexplored. This project bridges the gap by leveraging **machine learning models** trained on wearable sensor data to replicate the functionality of a personal trainer, including:
- Tracking exercises
- Counting repetitions
- Detecting improper form

## ‚ú® Features
- **Exercise Recognition**: Classifies exercises (Bench Press, Deadlift, Squat, Overhead Press, and Row) with high accuracy.
- **Repetition Counting**: Tracks repetitions with ~5% error.
- **Form Analysis**: Detects improper movement patterns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Optimized algorithms, including **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree**, deliver robust results.
- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Extracts temporal, frequency, and aggregated features for better predictions.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Noise reduction using Butterworth low-pass filtering.
   - Dimensionality reduction with PCA.
   - Aggregating time-series data into features.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Temporal: Standard deviation and mean across time windows.
   - Frequency: Fourier Transform-based features.
   - Clustering: K-Means for label refinement.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Tested Models: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
   - Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score.
